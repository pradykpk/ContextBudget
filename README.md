# ContextBudget

ContextBudget is a governance-first system for managing LLM context
using Kiro CLI. It enforces explicit observation, decision, execution,
and monitoring roles.

## Key Principles
- Context is finite
- Governance precedes optimization
- No silent modification
- Everything is auditable

## Agents
- Context Auditor (observe)
- Budget Enforcer (decide)
- Summarizer (execute)
- Risk Sentinel (monitor)

## How to Run
1. Start Kiro CLI from project root
2. Add runtime session
3. Run agents in sequence
4. Inspect logs
